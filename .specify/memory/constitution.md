# Containers Constitution

## Core Principles

### Ease of Container Usage
Containers must be designed to be simple to run and manage, with clear documentation and minimal setup steps.

Rationale: To reduce barriers for users adopting containerized solutions and promote widespread adoption.

### Intuitive Defaults
All containers must have sensible default configurations that work out of the box for common use cases.

Rationale: To allow quick starts without requiring deep knowledge of internal configurations, enabling faster development cycles.

### Standardized Entrypoints
Entrypoints must follow consistent patterns across all containers, using standard scripts and conventions.

Rationale: To ensure predictability, ease of integration, and maintainability across the container ecosystem.

### Minimal Configuration Overhead
Configuration must be optional and layered, with environment variables preferred over complex configuration files.

Rationale: To minimize user effort in customization while allowing flexibility for advanced use cases.

### Compatibility Across Environments
Containers must work seamlessly in local development, CI/CD pipelines, and cloud deployments without modifications.

Rationale: To support modern deployment workflows and ensure portability across different runtime environments.

## Additional Constraints
Technology stack requirements: Use Debian Linux as base images. Ensure containers follow Docker best practices, including multi-stage builds and non-root users.

Compliance standards: Containers must pass security scans and adhere to OWASP guidelines for container security.

## Development Workflow
Code review requirements: All changes require at least one maintainer review. Testing gates: Unit tests must pass, integration tests for container builds.

Deployment approval process: New containers require documentation and example usage before merge.

## Governance
Constitution supersedes all other practices; Amendments require documentation, approval, migration plan.

All PRs/reviews must verify compliance; Complexity must be justified; Use README.md for runtime development guidance.
