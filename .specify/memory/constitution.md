# Containers Constitution

## Core Principles

### I. Code Quality Standards
All container images must follow Docker best practices and security guidelines. Multi-stage builds are mandatory for production images. Images must be scanned for vulnerabilities using industry-standard tools. Base images should be minimal and from trusted sources. Configuration must be externalized and follow the 12-factor app principles.

### II. Comprehensive Testing
Every container must have automated tests covering build verification, configuration validation, and basic functionality. Integration tests must verify container orchestration compatibility. Security testing including vulnerability scanning and secret detection is required. Performance benchmarks must be established and monitored.

### III. User Experience Consistency
All containers must provide consistent configuration interfaces, logging formats, and health check endpoints. Documentation must follow standardized templates with clear setup instructions, configuration options, and troubleshooting guides. Container naming and tagging must follow semantic versioning conventions.

### IV. Security First
Security is non-negotiable. All containers must implement secure defaults, run as non-root users when possible, and include security hardening. Regular security audits and dependency updates are mandatory. Secrets management must follow industry best practices with no hardcoded credentials.

### V. Performance Optimization
Container images must be optimized for size, startup time, and resource usage. Multi-stage builds must minimize final image size. Performance benchmarks must be established for CPU, memory, and I/O usage. Startup time targets must be defined and monitored for each container type.

## Technical Standards

### Container Requirements
- All containers must support health checks via HTTP endpoints or command-based checks
- Environment variables must be used for all configuration (no hardcoded values)
- Containers must handle graceful shutdown signals (SIGTERM) properly
- Logging must follow structured format (JSON) with configurable log levels
- Timezone must be configurable via environment variables

### Image Standards
- Images must be built for multiple architectures when applicable (amd64, arm64)
- Image size must be minimized through multi-stage builds and cleanup
- Base images must be updated regularly to address security vulnerabilities
- Labels must include metadata about build date, version, and maintainer

## Quality Assurance

### Development Workflow
- All changes must be reviewed and tested before merging
- Automated CI/CD pipelines must include build, test, security scan, and deployment stages
- Container images must be versioned and immutable once built
- Rollback procedures must be documented and tested for each container

### Compliance and Monitoring
- All containers must pass security vulnerability scans
- Performance metrics must be collected and monitored
- Container health and resource usage must be observable
- Incident response procedures must be documented for each critical service

## Governance

Constitution supersedes all other practices. Amendments require:
1. Clear justification for the change
2. Impact assessment on existing containers
3. Migration plan for affected containers
4. Approval from maintainers
5. Documentation of the change and rationale

All container development must verify compliance with these principles. Complexity must be justified and alternatives considered. Use this constitution as the foundation for all container design and implementation decisions.
