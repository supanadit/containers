# Containers

This is a collection of Docker containers that I have created for various purposes. I try to make it an alternative to Bitnami's containers, with a focus on transparency and providing a great developer experience. You don't need a bachelor's degree to run Patroni, and you don't need to be a Docker expert to run these containers. I try to make them as simple as possible, while still providing all the features you need.

If you have any questions or suggestions, please feel free to open an issue or a pull request. I am always happy to help and improve my containers. I hope you find them useful and enjoy using them as much as I enjoyed creating them.

You can also request a container that you need, and I will try to create it for you. Just open an issue with the details of the container you need, and I will do my best.
