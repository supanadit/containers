# Feature Specification: Enhance PostgreSQL Container Maintainability

**Feature Branch**: `001-enhance-existing-postgresql`
**Created**: 2025-09-22
**Status**: Draft
**Input**: User description: "enhance existing postgresql dockerfile by splitting entrypoint.sh into separate shell script for maintainability, and add a complete testing for it"

## Execution Flow (main)
```
1. Parse user description from Input
   ‚Üí If empty: ERROR "No feature description provided"
2. Extract key concepts from description
   ‚Üí Identify: actors, actions, data, constraints
3. For each unclear aspect:
   ‚Üí Mark with [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: specific question]
4. Fill User Scenarios & Testing section
   ‚Üí If no clear user flow: ERROR "Cannot determine user scenarios"
5. Generate Functional Requirements
   ‚Üí Each requirement must be testable
   ‚Üí Mark ambiguous requirements
6. Identify Key Entities (if data involved)
7. Run Review Checklist
   ‚Üí If any [NEEDS CLARIFICATION]: WARN "Spec has uncertainties"
   ‚Üí If implementation details found: ERROR "Remove tech details"
8. Return: SUCCESS (spec ready for planning)
```

## ‚ö° Quick Guidelines
- ‚úÖ Focus on WHAT users need and WHY
- ‚ùå Avoid HOW to implement (no tech stack, APIs, code structure)
- üë• Written for business stakeholders, not developers

### Section Requirements
- **Mandatory sections**: Must be completed for every feature
- **Optional sections**: Include only when relevant to the feature
- When a section doesn't apply, remove it entirely (don't leave as "N/A")

### For AI Generation
When creating this spec from a user prompt:
1. **Mark all ambiguities**: Use [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: specific question] for any assumption you'd need to make
2. **Don't guess**: If the prompt doesn't specify something (e.g., "login system" without auth method), mark it
3. **Think like a tester**: Every vague requirement should fail the "testable and unambiguous" checklist item
4. **Common underspecified areas**:
   - User types and permissions
   - Data retention/deletion policies
   - Performance targets and scale
   - Error handling behaviors
   - Integration requirements
   - Security/compliance needs

## User Scenarios & Testing *(mandatory)*

### Primary User Story
As a container maintainer, I want the PostgreSQL container's entrypoint script to be split into smaller, focused scripts so that I can easily maintain and modify specific functionality without affecting the entire startup process.

### Acceptance Scenarios
1. **Given** a PostgreSQL container with a complex entrypoint script, **When** I need to modify database initialization logic, **Then** I can update only the initialization script without touching startup or shutdown code.
2. **Given** a PostgreSQL container that needs testing, **When** I run the test suite, **Then** all container startup scenarios are validated including normal startup, Patroni mode, sleep mode, and error conditions.
3. **Given** a PostgreSQL container with split scripts, **When** I deploy it, **Then** the container behaves identically to the original version but with improved maintainability.

### Edge Cases
- What happens when configuration files are missing during initialization?
- How does the system handle partial script failures during startup?
- What happens when the container receives multiple shutdown signals?
- How does testing work when external dependencies (like Patroni config) are unavailable?

## Requirements *(mandatory)*

### Functional Requirements
- **FR-001**: Container MUST maintain identical behavior to original entrypoint after script splitting
- **FR-002**: PostgreSQL database MUST initialize correctly when data directory is empty
- **FR-003**: Container MUST start PostgreSQL in direct mode when USE_PATRONI is not set
- **FR-004**: Container MUST start Patroni when USE_PATRONI is set to true
- **FR-005**: Container MUST enter sleep mode when SLEEP_MODE is set to true
- **FR-006**: Container MUST handle graceful shutdown via SIGTERM signal within 30 seconds
- **FR-007**: Configuration files MUST be properly copied and permissions set during initialization
- **FR-008**: Archive settings MUST be configured for pgBackRest when enabled
- **FR-009**: Test suite MUST validate all startup paths and error conditions
- **FR-010**: Test suite MUST verify configuration file handling and permissions
- **FR-011**: Test suite MUST test graceful shutdown behavior under various conditions
- **FR-012**: Test suite MUST validate Patroni integration when applicable

### Key Entities *(include if feature involves data)*
- **PostgreSQL Container**: Docker container with PostgreSQL database and supporting tools
- **Entrypoint Scripts**: Modular shell scripts handling different aspects of container startup
- **Configuration Files**: postgresql.conf, pg_hba.conf, and Patroni configuration
- **Test Suite**: Automated tests validating container behavior and functionality
