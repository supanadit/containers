# Container Tasks: postgresql

**Input**: Container design documents from `/specs/001-add-password-modification/`
**Prerequisites**: plan.md (required), research.md, dockerfile-design.md, configuration.md

## Container Execution Flow (main)
```
1. Load plan.md from container directory
   → If not found: ERROR "No container implementation plan found"
   → Extract: container type, base image, runtime, structure
2. Load container design documents:
   → dockerfile-design.md: Extract build stages → Dockerfile tasks
   → configuration.md: Extract config templates → configuration tasks
   → research.md: Extract base image decisions → setup tasks
3. Generate container tasks by category:
   → Foundation: directory structure, base image setup, user creation
   → Build: multi-stage Dockerfile, dependency installation, optimization
   → Runtime: entrypoint scripts, configuration templates, health checks
   → Testing: build validation, security scanning, functionality tests
   → Integration: layer caching, volume mounting, network configuration
   → Validation: performance testing, documentation, cleanup
4. Apply container task rules:
   → Different files = mark [P] for parallel
   → Same Dockerfile stage = sequential (no [P])
   → Build stages before runtime scripts
   → Implementation before testing
5. Number tasks sequentially (C001, C002...)
6. Generate container dependency graph
7. Create parallel build examples
8. Validate container task completeness:
   → All Dockerfile stages have build tasks?
   → All runtime requirements have scripts?
   → All container functionality tested?
   → All security requirements addressed?
9. Return: SUCCESS (container tasks ready for execution)
```

## Format: `[C-ID] [P?] Container Task Description`
- **[P]**: Can run in parallel (different files, no container dependencies)
- Include exact container file paths in descriptions
- Use C### numbering for container tasks (C001, C002, etc.)

## Container Path Conventions
- **Single container**: `docker/postgresql/`
- **Container structure**: Following established patterns from existing containers
- Paths shown below assume single container modification

## Phase 3.1: Container Foundation
- [x] C001 Analyze current database initialization script structure in docker/postgresql/entrypoint.d/scripts/init/02-database.sh

## Phase 3.2: Multi-stage Dockerfile Build
- [x] C002 [P] Verify Dockerfile compatibility with new environment variables (no changes needed)

## Phase 3.3: Container Scripts
- [x] C003 Add TIMEOUT_CHANGE_PASSWORD environment variable handling in docker/postgresql/entrypoint.d/scripts/init/02-database.sh
- [x] C004 Implement password sanitization function in docker/postgresql/entrypoint.d/scripts/init/02-database.sh
- [x] C005 Add password modification logic with timeout mechanism in docker/postgresql/entrypoint.d/scripts/init/02-database.sh
- [x] C006 Update logging to include password modification events in docker/postgresql/entrypoint.d/scripts/init/02-database.sh
- [x] C007 Add error handling for database initialization failures during password setting in docker/postgresql/entrypoint.d/scripts/init/02-database.sh
- [x] C008 Add graceful shutdown handling during password modification in docker/postgresql/entrypoint.d/scripts/init/02-database.sh

## Phase 3.4: Container Configuration
- [x] C009 [P] Document TIMEOUT_CHANGE_PASSWORD in docker/postgresql/README.md
- [x] C010 [P] Update quickstart documentation with password modification examples in docker/postgresql/README.md

## Phase 3.5: Container Testing
- [x] C011 [P] Create unit test for password sanitization function in docker/postgresql/tests/unit_test.sh
- [x] C012 [P] Create integration test for password setting on first startup in docker/postgresql/tests/integration_test.sh
- [x] C013 [P] Create test for invalid password handling in docker/postgresql/tests/integration_test.sh
- [x] C014 [P] Create test for timeout handling in docker/postgresql/tests/integration_test.sh
- [x] C015 [P] Create security test to ensure password values are not logged in docker/postgresql/tests/security_test.sh
- [x] C016 [P] Create test for graceful shutdown during password modification in docker/postgresql/tests/integration_test.sh

## Phase 3.6: Container Integration & Validation
- [x] C017 Run complete container build and test validation
- [x] C018 [P] Update container documentation with password modification feature in docker/postgresql/README.md
- [x] C019 Final security audit for password handling implementation
- [x] C020 Performance validation for password modification timing

## Container Dependencies
- Foundation (C001) before all script modifications (C003-C008)
- Script modifications (C003-C008) before testing (C011-C016)
- Configuration updates (C009-C010) can run in parallel with script modifications
- Testing (C011-C016) before integration validation (C017-C020)
- C003 (env handling) before C004-C005 (password logic)
- C004 (sanitization) before C005 (modification logic)
- C005 (modification) before C006 (logging), C007 (error handling), C008 (shutdown)

## Container Parallel Execution Example
```
# Launch C011-C016 together (different test files):
Task: "Create unit test for password sanitization function in docker/postgresql/tests/unit_test.sh"
Task: "Create integration test for password setting on first startup in docker/postgresql/tests/integration_test.sh"
Task: "Create test for invalid password handling in docker/postgresql/tests/integration_test.sh"
Task: "Create test for timeout handling in docker/postgresql/tests/integration_test.sh"
Task: "Create security test to ensure password values are not logged in docker/postgresql/tests/security_test.sh"
Task: "Create test for graceful shutdown during password modification in docker/postgresql/tests/integration_test.sh"

# Launch C009-C010 together (same README file - sequential):
Task: "Document TIMEOUT_CHANGE_PASSWORD in docker/postgresql/README.md"
Task: "Update quickstart documentation with password modification examples in docker/postgresql/README.md"
```

## Container Task Notes
- [P] tasks = different container files, no build dependencies
- Commit after each container task completion
- Follow established container patterns from existing containers in repository
- Avoid: vague container tasks, script conflicts, same file modifications in parallel
- Container tasks must follow Docker and OCI best practices
- Ensure password security and proper error handling in all implementation tasks
- Non-root user and existing security measures must be preserved
- All containers must have health checks and proper signal handling (unchanged)
- Security scanning and validation required for password handling

## Container Task Generation Rules
*Applied during main() execution*

1. **From Container Configuration**:
   - Each new env var → env handling task
   - Each config update → documentation task [P]
   
2. **From Container Runtime Requirements**:
   - Each password handling step → script modification task
   - Each error scenario → error handling task
   - Each logging requirement → logging task

3. **From Container Test Scenarios**:
   - Each password scenario → integration test [P]
   - Each security requirement → security test [P]
   - Each performance goal → performance test [P]
   - Each edge case → specific test [P]

4. **Container Ordering Rules**:
   - Analysis → Implementation → Testing → Validation
   - Environment handling before password logic
   - Password logic before error handling and logging
   - Implementation before documentation updates
