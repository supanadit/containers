# Container Implementation Plan: postgresql

**Branch**: `001-add-password-modification` | **Date**: September 26, 2025 | **Spec**: /home/supanadit/Workspaces/Personal/Docker/containers/specs/001-add-password-modification/spec.md
**Input**: Container specification from `/specs/001-add-password-modification/spec.md`

## Execution Flow (/plan command scope)
```
1. Load container spec from Input path
   → If not found: ERROR "No container spec at {path}"
2. Fill Container Technical Context (scan for NEEDS CLARIFICATION)
   → Detect Container Type from context (service, database, proxy, tool, etc.)
   → Set Base Image Strategy (FROM decision)
   → Determine Multi-stage Build Requirements
3. Fill the Constitution Check section based on the container constitution document.
4. Evaluate Constitution Check section below
   → If violations exist: Document in Complexity Tracking
   → If no justification possible: ERROR "Simplify approach first"
   → Update Progress Tracking: Initial Constitution Check
5. Execute Phase 0 → research.md
   → If NEEDS CLARIFICATION remain: ERROR "Resolve unknowns"
6. Execute Phase 1 → dockerfile-design.md, configuration.md, quickstart.md, agent-specific template file
7. Re-evaluate Constitution Check section
   → If new violations: Refactor design, return to Phase 1
   → Update Progress Tracking: Post-Design Constitution Check
8. Plan Phase 2 → Describe container build/test task generation approach (DO NOT create tasks.md)
9. STOP - Ready for /tasks command
```

**IMPORTANT**: The /plan command STOPS at step 8. Phases 2-4 are executed by other commands:
- Phase 2: /tasks command creates tasks.md
- Phase 3-4: Implementation execution (manual or via tools)

## Summary
PostgreSQL database container with password modification for the postgres user on first startup using the existing POSTGRES_PASSWORD environment variable. The implementation will modify the database initialization script to securely set the password during container startup, ensuring it only occurs once and handles edge cases appropriately.

**Structure Decision**: Single container per directory following established patterns

## Phase 0: Container Research & Analysis
1. **Extract unknowns from Container Technical Context** above:
   - For each NEEDS CLARIFICATION → containerization research task
   - For each base image decision → security and size analysis
   - For each runtime dependency → installation and optimization patterns
   - For each configuration method → best practices research

2. **Generate and dispatch container research agents**:
   ```
   For each unknown in Container Technical Context:
     Task: "Research {unknown} for containerization of {app/service}"
     Focus: Docker best practices, security, performance, size optimization
   For each base image option:
     Task: "Analyze {base-image} for {app-type} containers"
     Focus: Security updates, size, compatibility, ecosystem support
   For each deployment pattern:
     Task: "Research {deployment-pattern} for {container-type}"
     Focus: Orchestration compatibility, scaling, resource management
   ```

3. **Consolidate container findings** in `research.md` using format:
   - **Base Image Decision**: [chosen base image and version]
   - **Build Strategy**: [multi-stage approach and optimization techniques]
   - **Security Approach**: [hardening measures and user configuration]
   - **Configuration Strategy**: [env vars, volumes, secrets management]
   - **Monitoring & Health**: [health check implementation and logging]
   - **Alternatives Considered**: [what else was evaluated and why rejected]

**Output**: research.md with all containerization NEEDS CLARIFICATION resolved

## Phase 1: Container Design & Architecture
*Prerequisites: research.md complete*

1. **Design Dockerfile architecture** → `dockerfile-design.md`:
   - Multi-stage build strategy with stage purposes
   - Base image justification and security considerations
   - Build dependencies vs runtime dependencies
   - Layer optimization and caching strategy
   - User creation and permission model
   - Working directory and file system layout

2. **Design container configuration** → `configuration.md`:
   - Environment variables with defaults and validation
   - Volume mount points and data persistence strategy
   - Port exposure and network requirements
   - Health check implementation (endpoint, command, or script)
   - Logging configuration and output destinations
   - Signal handling and graceful shutdown
   - Resource limits and requirements

3. **Design container lifecycle scripts**:
   - Setup script structure for build-time installation
   - Entrypoint script for runtime initialization
   - Init scripts for service preparation
   - Utility scripts for maintenance and debugging

4. **Generate container test scenarios** from requirements:
   - Build test: Multi-stage build validation
   - Security test: Non-root user, file permissions, CVE scanning
   - Integration test: Service functionality within container
   - Performance test: Startup time, resource usage, throughput
   - Health test: Health check endpoint validation

5. **Update agent file incrementally** (O(1) operation):
   - Run `.specify/scripts/bash/update-agent-context.sh copilot`
     **IMPORTANT**: Execute it exactly as specified above. Do not add or remove any arguments.
   - If exists: Add only NEW container tech from current plan
   - Preserve manual additions between markers
   - Update recent changes (keep last 3)
   - Keep under 150 lines for token efficiency
   - Output to repository root

**Output**: dockerfile-design.md, configuration.md, quickstart.md, agent-specific file

## Phase 2: Container Task Planning
*Prerequisites: Phase 1 complete*

1. **Analyze container modification scope**:
   - Script changes in entrypoint.d/scripts/init/02-database.sh
   - New environment variable TIMEOUT_CHANGE_PASSWORD
   - Password sanitization and validation logic
   - Error handling for database initialization failures
   - Logging for password modification actions

2. **Generate container implementation tasks**:
   - Modify 02-database.sh to add password setting logic
   - Add TIMEOUT_CHANGE_PASSWORD environment variable handling
   - Implement password sanitization function
   - Add timeout mechanism for password operations
   - Update logging to include password modification events
   - Add tests for password modification scenarios

3. **Container testing strategy**:
   - Unit tests for password sanitization
   - Integration tests for password setting on first startup
   - Security tests to ensure password not logged
   - Performance tests for timeout handling
   - Edge case tests for invalid passwords and failures

**Estimated Output**: 8-12 numbered tasks focused on script modifications and testing

**IMPORTANT**: This phase is executed by the /tasks command, NOT by /plan

## Phase 3+: Container Implementation
*These phases are beyond the scope of the /plan command*

**Phase 3**: Container task execution (/tasks command creates tasks.md)  
**Phase 4**: Container implementation (execute tasks.md following container constitutional principles)  
**Phase 5**: Container validation (build tests, run quickstart.md, security scanning, performance validation)

## Container Complexity Tracking
*Fill ONLY if Container Constitution Check has violations that must be justified*

| Violation | Why Needed | Simpler Alternative Rejected Because |
|-----------|------------|-------------------------------------|
| [e.g., Ubuntu base instead of Alpine] | [specific compatibility requirement] | [why Alpine insufficient for this use case] |
| [e.g., Root user required] | [legacy application constraint] | [why non-root user breaks functionality] |
| [e.g., Multiple processes in container] | [tightly coupled services] | [why separate containers not feasible] |
