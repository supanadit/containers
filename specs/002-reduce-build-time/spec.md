# Feature Specification: Optimize PostgreSQL Build Process

**Feature Branch**: `002-reduce-build-time`  
**Created**: September 22, 2025  
**Status**: Draft  
**Input**: User description: "reduce build time and optimize build step while building postgresql, everytime we change entrypoint.sh / all files in entrypoint.d we rebuild everything from start which wasting time and too long too wait."

## User Scenarios & Testing *(mandatory)*

### Primary User Story
As a developer working on the PostgreSQL container, I want the Docker build process to be optimized so that changes to entrypoint.sh or files in entrypoint.d do not trigger a full rebuild from scratch, reducing build time and improving development efficiency.

### Acceptance Scenarios
1. **Given** the PostgreSQL container has been built previously, **When** I modify entrypoint.sh, **Then** the build should reuse cached layers for unchanged components and only rebuild the necessary parts.
2. **Given** the PostgreSQL container has been built previously, **When** I modify files in entrypoint.d/scripts/, **Then** the build time should be significantly reduced by leveraging Docker layer caching.

### Edge Cases
- What happens when dependencies in setup scripts change? [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: Should the build still optimize or force rebuild?]
- How does the system handle changes to utility scripts in entrypoint.d/scripts/utils/?

## Requirements *(mandatory)*

### Functional Requirements
- **FR-001**: The Docker build process MUST utilize layer caching to avoid rebuilding unchanged components when only entrypoint.sh or entrypoint.d files are modified.
- **FR-002**: The Dockerfile MUST be structured to separate frequently changing files (like entrypoint scripts) into later layers to maximize cache hits.
- **FR-003**: Build time for incremental changes to entrypoint-related files MUST be reduced by at least 50% compared to full rebuilds.
- **FR-004**: The system MUST maintain build correctness, ensuring that cached layers do not introduce stale dependencies.
