# Research: Optimize PostgreSQL Build Process

## Docker Build Optimization Techniques

### Decision: Implement Multi-Stage Build with Layer Separation
**Rationale**: Separate infrequently changing setup scripts from frequently changing entrypoint scripts to maximize Docker layer caching. Setup scripts (dependencies, PostgreSQL installation) change rarely, while entrypoint scripts change during development.

**Alternatives Considered**:
- Single-stage build: Simple but rebuilds everything on any change
- Multi-stage with COPY optimization: Similar but less explicit layer separation
- BuildKit with cache mounts: Advanced but increases complexity

### Decision: Order COPY Commands by Change Frequency
**Rationale**: Copy stable files (setup scripts, dependencies) early in Dockerfile, followed by volatile files (entrypoint scripts) to ensure cache hits for unchanged layers.

**Alternatives Considered**:
- Alphabetical ordering: Ignores change frequency
- Single COPY command: No layer separation
- .dockerignore optimization: Helpful but doesn't address layer ordering

### Decision: Use BuildKit for Advanced Caching
**Rationale**: BuildKit provides better caching, parallel builds, and secret management. Enables cache mounts for package managers if needed.

**Alternatives Considered**:
- Legacy Docker builder: Slower, less efficient caching
- Third-party build tools: Increases complexity and dependencies

### Decision: Maintain Script Modularity
**Rationale**: Keep existing modular structure (setup/scripts/, entrypoint.d/scripts/) to allow independent changes without affecting other layers.

**Alternatives Considered**:
- Monolithic scripts: Harder to maintain and cache
- Inline scripts in Dockerfile: Less maintainable

## Performance Benchmarks

### Current State Analysis
- Full rebuild time: ~10-15 minutes (estimated)
- Setup layer changes: Rare (dependency updates)
- Entrypoint changes: Frequent (development)

### Target Improvements
- Entrypoint-only changes: <2 minutes rebuild
- Setup changes: Full rebuild still required but optimized
- Cache hit rate: >80% for development builds

## Security Considerations
- Multi-stage builds reduce attack surface
- Non-root execution maintained
- No secrets in build layers

## Testing Strategy
- Build time measurements before/after
- Cache validation tests
- Functional tests ensure correctness
